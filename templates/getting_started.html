    <h1>📜 Lawyer’s Quest</h1>
    <h2>A Heroic Legal Adventure</h2>

    <p class="flair">So begins your journey, noble squire of the legal arts. Let this scroll be your guide as you seek knowledge, power, and justice across the Realm of Legalia...</p>

    <h2>🎓 Step 1: The Binding of Identity</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Enter your sacred <strong>Squire ID</strong>—a magical code bestowed by your professor.</li>
      <li>Choose your <strong>Course of Study</strong>, aligning your path with the law you wish to master.</li>
      <li>Select your <strong>Quest</strong> from the scroll of missions to begin your saga. Numerous quests will appear with time, Squire, as you advance in your knowledge of Ye Olde Law.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🗺️ Step 2: Traversing the Map</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the mystical arrows or type <strong>N / S / E / W</strong> to move across the grid of fate.</li>
      <li>Each move consumes precious <strong>Food</strong>. Without it, thou shalt not pass! By the way, food costs bits, which you can earn in myriad ways, but starting out you probably will have to work in BitTown (press V on the map to access it).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📦 Step 3: Of Chests and Riddles</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Stumble upon <strong>Treasure Chests</strong> filled with riddles ancient and obscure.</li>
      <li>Answer correctly to gain <strong>Gold</strong>, <strong>XP</strong>, and enchanted <strong>Items</strong>.</li>
      <li>Attempt as many times as needed—but only the wise prevail swiftly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>⚔️ Step 4: Facing the Foes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Enemies lurk in the legal shadows. Some strike first; others test your knowledge.</li>
      <li>Vanquish them through combat or by besting them in <strong>True/False legal duels</strong>, though combat requires specialized weaponry (the pen is mightier than the sword!)</li>
      <li>Victory brings loot, honor, and perhaps... a snack.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🎒 Step 5: The Art of Inventory</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Collect items to enhance your skills—<strong>Shields</strong>, <strong>Rings</strong>, even <strongSnackables</strong>.</li>
      <li>Visit the <strong>Shop</strong> to trade gold for gear and grub.</li>
      <li>The best gear auto-equips, for your hands are too full of justice.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🧠 The Final Trial: Lexiconis the Imp</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>In <strong>Quest 14</strong>, face the devious Lexiconis, Imp of Confusion and Mistruths.</li>
      <li>To triumph, answer questions correctly and limit your mistakes—lest your mind be muddled forever.</li>
      <li>Victory means glory. Defeat? A second chance... if you dare.</li>
      <li>Other conflicts await you over the mountains and across the rivers. Stay tuned for battles over contracts, intellectual property, employment and more!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>⚖️ Adventurer’s Tips</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Ration food wisely. You can’t argue your way out of starvation.</li>
      <li>Farther from (0,0) lie greater treasures—and greater trials.</li>
      <li>Upgrade gear whenever possible. The law favors the prepared.</li>
      <li>Enjoy the journey! Every question you conquer is a step closer to legal legend.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="flair">Now go, valiant student! The court of destiny awaits... 🏛️</p>
